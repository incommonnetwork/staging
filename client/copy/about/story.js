    `In November 2018, days before a highly anticipated conference in New York City, the promoter pulled the plug. Hundreds of ticket holders, many from across the world, were left with no refund and no recourse. In the last minutes, a “rescue” event was planned. 

Instead of an auditorium, we had a beer hall, a museum, and a cash bar.

Instead of lectures and panels, we had conversations.

Instead of being spectators, we were participants.

InCommon was born out of the beauty created by crisis. But immediately afterward, we realized there’s no reason we can’t bring people together every day.`;
